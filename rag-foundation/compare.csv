An example of human-human chat on AntiScam dataset is shown in Table TABREF25.,An example of human-human chat on AntiScam dataset is shown in Table TABREF25.,"There are two tasks for the users: firstly, users are required to chat with their partners and determine if they are attackers or not, reporting their decisions at the end of the task. If users think their partners are attackers, they are instructed to prolong the conversation and elicit information from their partners. We give a bonus to users if they detect the attackers and elicit real information from the attackers, including the attacker's name, address and phone number. Since one worker can only participate once in the task, they do not know their partners are always attackers."
"To enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information. As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example. We evaluate MISSA on the newly collected AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that MISSA outperforms multiple competitive baselines.","To enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information.

"We evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets. AntiScam aims to build a dialog system that occupies the attacker's attention and elicits the attacker's information while PersuasionForGood BIBREF1 aims to build a dialog system that persuades people to donate to a charity. We use $80\%$ data for training, $10\%$ data for validation, and $10\%$ data for testing. More training details are presented in Appendix.","We evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets.

We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal."
"Table TABREF19 presents the main experiment results on AntiScam dataset, for both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics. The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.","In summary, our contributions include: (i) We design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a semantic slot annotation scheme to annotate the non-collaborative dialog dataset, we also propose a carefully-designed AntiScam dataset to facilitate the research of non-collaborative dialog systems. (ii) We propose a model that can be applied to all non-collaborative tasks, outperforming other baselines on two different non-collaborative tasks. (iii) We develop an anti-scam dialog system to occupy attacker's attention and elicit their private information for social good. Furthermore, we also build a persuasion dialog system to persuade people to donate to charities. We release the code and data.","We train MISSA in a multi-task fashion. In addition to the language model task and the next-utterance prediction task, we also use separate classifiers to predict the intents and semantic slots of both human utterances and system responses. The intent classifier and semantic slot classifier for human utterances capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of human utterances, providing information to select the appropriate response among response candidates while the classifiers for the system intents and semantic slots are designed to help select an appropriate next-sentence. We describe response filtering in the corresponding subsection. Classifiers are designed as the following equation:"
We test our approach on two non-collaborative task datasets: the AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1. Both datasets are collected from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in the form of typing conversations and off-task dialog is interleaved in the dialog.,"In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents.","To explore the influence of the intent-based conditional response generation method and the designed response filter, we perform an ablation study. The results are shown in Table TABREF19. We find that MISSA has higher fluency score and coherence score than MISSA-con (4.18 vs 3.78 for fluency, and 3.75 vs 3.68 for coherence), which suggests that conditioning on the system intent to generate responses improves the quality of the generated sentences. Compared with MISSA-sel, MISSA achieves better performance on all the metrics. For example, the engagement score for MISSA is 3.69 while MISSA-sel only has 2.87. This is because the response filter removed all the incoherent responses, which makes the attacker more willing to keep chatting. The ablation study shows both the conditional language generation mechanism and the response filter are essential to MISSA's good performance."
