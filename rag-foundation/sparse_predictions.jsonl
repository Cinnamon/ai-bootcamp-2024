In future work, we hope to use our findings to improve performance on tasks such as abusive language detection. We also hope to delve into finer-grained analyses, exploring how language around gender interacts with other variables, such as sexual orientation or profession (e.g. actresses versus female athletes). Finally, we plan to continue widening the scope of our study \u2013 for example, expanding our methods to include non-binary gender identities, evaluating changes in gender norms over time, and spreading to more domains, such as the political sphere.", "To test cluster labels, we present the annotator with a label and a word, and we ask them whether the word falls under the concept. The concept is a potential cluster label and the word is either a word from that cluster or drawn randomly from the domain vocabulary. For a good label, the rate at which in-cluster words fall under the label should be much higher than the rate at which out-of-cluster words fall under. In our experiments, we tested the top 4 predicted labels and the centroid of the cluster as a strong baseline label. The centroid achieved an in-cluster rate of .60 and out-of-cluster rate of .18 (difference of .42). Our best performing predicted label achieved an in-cluster rate of .65 and an out-of-cluster rate of .04 (difference of .61), thus outperforming the centroid on both rates and increasing the gap between rates by nearly 20 points. In the Appendix, we include more detailed results on both tasks.", "Our first goal was to discover words that are significantly associated with men or women in a given domain. We employed an approach used by BIBREF10 in their work to analyze differences in how men and women write on Twitter.", "Less studied in NLP is how gender norms manifest in everyday language \u2013 do people talk about women and men in different ways? These types of differences are far subtler than abusive language, but they can provide valuable insight into the roots of more extreme acts of discrimination. Subtle differences are difficult to observe because each case on its own could be attributed to circumstance, a passing comment or an accidental word. However, at the level of hundreds of thousands of data points, these patterns, if they do exist, become undeniable. Thus, in this work, we introduce new datasets and methods so that we can study subtle gender associations in language at the large-scale."]}

The selective gate can mitigate problems existing in distantly supervised relation extraction and achieve a satisfactory empirical effectiveness. Specifically, when handling the noisy instance problem, selective attention tries to produce a distribution over all sentence in a bag; but if there is only one sentence in the bag, even the only sentence is wrongly labeled, the selective attention mechanism will be low-effective or even completely useless. Note that almost $80\\%$ of bags from popular relation extraction benchmark consist of only one sentence, and many of them suffer from the wrong label problem. In contrast, our proposed gate mechanism is competent to tackle such case by directly and dynamically aligning low gating value to the wrongly labeled instances and thus preventing noise representation being propagated.", "where, $\\mathbf {W}^{(g1)} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{3d_c \\times d_h}$, $\\mathbf {W}^{(g2)} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_h \\times d_h}$, $\\sigma (\\cdot )$ denotes an activation function and $g_j \\in (0, 1)$.

However, Twitter is highly informal, space-restricted, and subject to frequent topic fluctuations from one post to the next due to the ebb and flow of current events\u2014in short, it is not broadly representative of most text domains. Thus, sarcasm detectors trained using features designed for maximum Twitter performance are not necessarily transferable to other domains. Despite this, it is desirable to develop approaches that can harness the more generalizable information present in the abundance of Twitter data."]}

Specifically, we see the importance of using GloVe as pre-trained word embeddings, how word dropout improves generalization, and how context size plays an important role in the final classification result (showing one of our experiments).", "We outline the organization of the rest of the paper as follows. In Section 2, we briefly explore earlier efforts in WSD and discuss recent approaches that incorporate deep neural networks and word embeddings. Our main model that employs BLSTM with the sense and word embeddings is detailed in Section 3. We then present our experiments and results in Section 4 supported by a discussion on how to avoid some drawbacks of the current model in order to achieve higher accuracies and demand less number of training data which is desirable. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with some future research directions for the construction of sense embeddings as well as applications of such model in other domains such as biomedicine.", "Between-all-models comparisons - When SensEval-3 task was launched 47 submissions (supervised and unsupervised algorithms) were received addressing this task. Afterward, some other papers tried to work on this data and reported their results in separate articles as well. We compare the result of our model with the top-performing and low-performing algorithms (supervised). We show our single model sits among the 5 top-performing algorithms, considering that in other algorithms for each ambiguous word one separate classifier is trained (i.e. in the same number of ambiguous words in a language there have to be classifiers; which means 57 classifiers for this specific task). Table TABREF19 shows the results of the top-performing and low-performing supervised algorithms.", "Due to the replacement of their softmax layers with a sigmoid layer in our network, we need to impose a modification in the input of the model. For this purpose, not only the contextual features are going to make the input of the network, but also, the sense for which we are interested to find out whether that given context makes sense or not (no pun intended) would be provided to the network. Next, the context words would be transferred to a sequence of word embeddings while the sense would be represented as a sense embedding (the shaded embeddings in Fig. FIGREF4 ). For a set of candidate senses (i.e. INLINEFORM0 ) for an ambiguous term, after computing cosine similarities of each sense embedding with the word embeddings of the context words, we expect the sequence result of similarities between the true sense and the surrounding context communicate a pattern-like information that can be encoded through our BLSTM network; for the incorrect senses this premise does not hold. Several WSD studies already incorporated the idea of sense-context cosine similarities in their models BIBREF17 BIBREF18 ."]}

There is no need for a maximum number of instructions for a recipe to be considered as valid for training or testing; only for total words, making more samples of the large Recipe1M corpus usable for training. Through ingredient attention, we are able to unveil internal focus in the text processing path by observing attention weights. Incorporation of new samples in the train set can be done by retraining just one model. Overall, an accurate and flexible method for recipe retrieval from meal images could provide downstream models (e.g. automatic nutrient content estimation) with decisive information and significantly improve their results."]}

This has been achieved with a next frame prediction (NFP) loss function as, INLINEFORM3 . So given an input image, the PFC can predict the corresponding text description; while given an input text command the PFC can predict the corresponding manipulated image. This NFP loss function has neuroscience foundation, since the molecular mediated synaptic plasticity always takes place after the completion of an event, when the information of both t and t+1 time points have been acquired and presented by the neural system.

The human thinking process normally would not form a concrete imagination through the full visual loop, but rather a vague and rapid imagination through the short-cut loop by feeding back INLINEFORM1 to AIT directly. On the other hand, the full path of clear imagination may explain the dream mechanism. Figure 7.B shows the short cut imagination process, where LGI also regarded the rotated \u20189\u2019 as digit 6, which suggests the AIT activation does not encode the digit identity, but the untangled features of input image or imagined image.

Greynir BIBREF22 is a full parser which also includes a tokeniser and recognises some types of named entities. Nefnir BIBREF28 is a lemmatiser which uses suffix substitution rules, derived from the Database of Icelandic Morphology BIBREF29, giving results that outperform IceNLP.

When constructing and maintaining lexical databases, such as DIM, the Icelandic wordnet or other related resources, it is vital to be able to systematically add neologies and words that are missing from the datasets, especially those commonly used in the language. Within the LT programme a flexible lexicon acquisition tool will be developed. It will be able to identify and collect unknown words and word forms, together with statistics, through structured lexical acquisition from the Icelandic Gigaword Corpus, which is constantly being updated, and other data sources in the same format."]}

The second group are semantic distance features, including the humor label classes from 5 sentences in the training set that are closest to this sentence (found by using a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method), and each sentence's averaged Word2Vec representations ( INLINEFORM0 ). More details can be found in BIBREF3 .", "Stemming from the present study, we envision that more research is worth pursuing: (a) for presentations, cues from other modalities such as audio or video will be included, similar to Bertero2016LREC; (b) context information from multiple utterances will be modeled by using sequential modeling methods.", "TED Talks are recordings from TED conferences and other special TED programs.

This behavior was to be expected since the modernization quality for El Conde Lucanor was very low. Therefore, the system consistently generated wrong suffixes, resulting in the user having to make more corrections.", "As a future work, we want to further research the behavior of the neural systems.

Given a text containing the description of an event which [id=lq]may or may not cause a certain emotion, we take [id=lq]an emotion word [id=lq]in context, such as \u201csad\u201d, as a query. The question to the QA system is: \u201cDoes the described event cause the emotion of sadness?\u201d. The [id=lq]expected answer [id=lq]is either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.

The cost-sensitive SVM reweighs the penalty parameter INLINEFORM0 of the error term by the inverse class-ratio.

Furthermore, without losing generality, MetaLDA can work with both regular texts and short texts. The improvement of MetaLDA over other models that also use meta information is more remarkable, particularly when the word-occurrence information is insufficient. As MetaLDA takes a particular approach for incorporating meta information on topic models, it is possible to apply the same approach to other Bayesian probabilistic models, where Dirichlet priors are used.

Previous researches either set the sentiment of a tweet directly based on a subjectivity lexicon BIBREF3 or preprocessed the tweet using a complex preprocessing method BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . BIBREF2 not only removed URLs, mentions, retweets, hashtags, numbers and stop words; but also tokenized the tweets and added not_ on negative words. BIBREF1 tokenized the tweets and separated URLs, emoticons, phone numbers, HTML tags, mentions, hashtags, fraction or decimals, and symbol or Unicode character repetition. This research analyzes sentiment on tweets about 2016 U.S. Presidential candidates. We will build a Naive Bayesian predictive model for each candidate and compare the prediction with RealClearPolitics.com. We expect to have a correct prediction on the leading candidates for Democratic and Republican Party.", "We preprocess the data by: (1) removing URLs and pictures, also (2) by filtering tweets which have candidates' name. Hashtags, mentions, and retweets are not removed in order to maintain the original meaning of a tweet. We only save tweets which have passed the two requirements such as in Table 1. The first example shows no change in the tweet's content, since there isn't any URLs or pictures, and it contains a candidate's name: Bernie Sanders. The second example shows a removed tweet, which doesn't contain any candidates' name. The preprocessing stage changes the third tweet's contents. It removes the URLs and still keeps the tweet because it contains \"Hillary Clinton\" and \"Donald Trump\". The preprocessing stage removes 41% of the data (Figure 2)."]}

This line of research was recently revisited by Lampos et al. to study the SES inference problem on Twitter. In a series of works BIBREF12 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF21 , the authors applied Gaussian Processes to predict user income, occupation and socioeconomic class based on demographic, psycho-linguistic features and a standardized job classification taxonomy which mapped Twitter users to their professional occupations. The high predictive performance has proven this concept with INLINEFORM0 for income prediction, and a precision of INLINEFORM1 for 9-ways SOC classification, and INLINEFORM2 for binary SES classification. Nevertheless, the models developed by the authors are learned by relying on datasets, which were manually labeled through an annotation process crowdsourced through Amazon Mechanical Turk at a high monetary cost."]}

The multimodal representation unifies the involved signals of different modalities into the same vector space for general downstream tasks. On multimodal fusion, special architectures, such as attention mechanism and bilinear pooling, are discussed. In the application section, three selected areas of broad interest are presented, which include image caption generation, text-to-image synthesis, and visual question answering. A set of visual reasoning methods for VQA is also discussed.", "In this paper, a technical review of the models and learning methods for multimodal intelligence is provided. The main focus is the combination of CV and NLP, which has become an important area for both research communities covering many different tasks and technologies. To provide a more structured perspective, we organize the methods selected in this technical review according to three key topics: representation, fusion, and applications.", "This section focuses on the study of a very interesting problem \u2013 visual reasoning, which is about how to conduct accurate, explicit, and expressive understanding and reasoning. Visual reasoning can involved by many language and vision based bimodal tasks, such as caption generation and text-to-image synthesis. However, in this section we mostly focus on the related methods for VQA as visual reasoning is particularly important when answering complicated questions. SAN is often considered as a pioneering work related to implicit visual reasoning since to its stacked structure can be viewed as to perform multiple reasoning steps. Shortly afterwards, feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) is proposed to refine visual features iteratively using feature-wise affine transforms based on the scaling factors and bias values generated dynamically from the textual features BIBREF245. Multimodal relational network (MuRel) also has a structure with multiple MuRel cells based on bilinear pooling, which can be used iteratively BIBREF246."]}

The authors of BIBREF8 hypothesize that the so-called residual mapping of $y=F(x)+x$ should be easier to optimize than the original mapping of $y=F(x)$. The design of the special building block is motivated by the observation in BIBREF6, BIBREF7 that accuracy degrades when more layers are stacked onto an already very deep CNN model. If the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, the deeper model should not have worse training error than the original shallower model without these added layers. The degradation actually suggests that the optimizer has difficulties in approximating identity mappings. With the identity shortcut connections in the ResNet building block, the optimizer can simply drive the layer weights toward zero to make the block identity mapping.

As performing inference for the entire layer is expensive, we only compute the outputs that are needed by the decoding graph instead of computing every output of the layer.

In future work, we could increase the dataset with other languages and use it for multilingual multi-document summarization. We release GameWikiSum for further research: https://github.com/Diego999/GameWikiSum.", "To ensure consistent results across all comparative experiments, extractive models generate summaries of the same length as reference summaries. In realistic scenarios, summary lengths are not pre-defined and can be adjusted to produce different types of summaries (e.g., short, medium or long). We do not explicitly constrain the output length for abstractive models, as each summary is auto-regressively generated.", "Table TABREF12 shows a comparison between GameWikiSum and other single and multi-document summarization datasets. GameWikiSum has larger input and output size than single document summarization corpora (used in extractive and abstractive models) while sharing similar word overlap ratios. Compared to DUC and TAC (news domain), GameWikiSum is also domain-specific and has two orders of magnitude more examples, facilitating the use of more powerful models. Finally, WikiSum has more samples but is more suitable for general abstractive summarization, as its articles cover a wide range of areas and have a lower word overlap ratio."]}

However, there are thousands of reviews emerging every day. Given the limited time and attention consumers have, it is impossible for them to allocate equal amount of attention to all the reviews. Moreover, some readers may be only interested in certain aspects of a product or TV series. It's been a waste of time to look at other irrelevant ones."]}

To compensate for this, we employ jackknifing BIBREF26 , which is standard practice in many NLP pipelines, such as dependency parsing."]}

RMR BIBREF7 extracts topics from reviews to enhance the user and item embeddings obtained by factorizing the rating matrix. TopicMF BIBREF8 jointly factorizes a rating matrix and bag-of-words representations of reviews to infer user and item embeddings. Despite the improvements achieved, these methods only focus on topical cues in reviews, but neglect the rich semantic contents.

In reality, however, the set of reviews for a user is fundamentally different from the set of reviews for an item. In particular, reviews for users correspond to a diverse set of items that they have rated, resulting in notably heterogeneous textual contents with a variety of topics for different items. In contrast, each item's reviews are only about itself, and the contents are thus homogeneous in the sense that the topic is limited to a single narrow domain.

Relation extraction methods typically answer with all the mountains in North America because of the lack of sophisticated representation for the mathematical function highest. To select the correct answer, one has to retrieve all the heights of the mountains, and sort them in descending order, and then pick the first entry.

We show that, in all tasks, the learning rate warm-up stage can be safely removed, and thus, the number of hyper-parameter is reduced.

This leads to an unstable training when using a large learning rate. We further show that the Transformer which locates the layer normalization inside the residual blocks, can be trained without the warm-up stage and converges much faster. In the future, we will investigate other strategies of positioning the layer normalization and understand the optimization of Transformer from a theoretical perspective.", "To verify whether using small-step updates mitigates the issue, we use a very small but fixed learning rate and check whether it can optimize the Post-LN Transformer (without the learning rate warm-up step) to a certain extent. In detail, we use a fixed learning rate of $1e^{-4}$ at the beginning of the optimization, which is much smaller than the $\\text{lr}_{max}= 1e^{-3}$ in the paper.

The CBOW model was then extended by BIBREF7 to learn distributed representations of documents. Specifically, they proposed Paragraph Vector Distributed Memory (PV-DM) model, in which the central word is predicted given the context words and the document vector. During training, PV-DM learns the word embeddings and the parameters of the softmax that models the conditional probability distribution for the central words. During inference, word embeddings and softmax weights are fixed, but the gradients are backpropagated to the inferred document vector.

Therefore, we first compute a set of 138 out-of-sample performance results, to be used as a gold standard (subsection sec:gold). In effect, our goal is to find the estimation procedure that best approximates this out-of-sample performance.", "Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations.", "We collected a large corpus of nearly 1.5 million Twitter posts written in 13 European languages. This is, to the best of our knowledge, by far the largest set of sentiment labeled tweets publicly available. We engaged native speakers to label the tweets based on the sentiment expressed in them. The sentiment label has three possible values: negative, neutral or positive. It turned out that the human annotators perceived the values as ordered. The quality of annotations varies though, and is estimated from the self- and inter-annotator agreements. All the details about the datasets, the annotator agreements, and the ordering of sentiment values are in our previous study BIBREF22 . The sentiment distribution and quality of individual language datasets is in Table TABREF2 . The tweets in the datasets are ordered by tweet ids, which corresponds to ordering by the time of posting.", "In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data.

Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios."]}

Sentiment classes are typically ordered and unbalanced, and the data itself is time-ordered. Taking these properties into account is important for the selection of appropriate estimation procedures.", "In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data.
