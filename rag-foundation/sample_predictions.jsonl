The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\n\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents. From Table TABREF19, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with TransferTransfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations.\n\nCompared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table TABREF21, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not.

As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example. We evaluate MISSA on the newly collected AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that MISSA outperforms multiple competitive baselines.\n\nIn summary, our contributions include: (i) We design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a semantic slot annotation scheme to annotate the non-collaborative dialog dataset, we also propose a carefully-designed AntiScam dataset to facilitate the research of non-collaborative dialog systems.

(iii) We develop an anti-scam dialog system to occupy attacker's attention and elicit their private information for social good. Furthermore, we also build a persuasion dialog system to persuade people to donate to charities. We release the code and data.\n\nThe interest in non-collaborative tasks has been increasing and there have already been several related datasets. For instance, BIBREF1 wang2019persuasion collected conversations where one participant persuades another to donate to a charity. BIBREF2 he2018decoupling collected negotiation dialogs where buyers and sellers bargain for items for sale on Craigslist. There are many other non-collaborative tasks, such as the turn-taking game BIBREF6, the multi-party game BIBREF7 and item splitting negotiation BIBREF8.", "We posted a role-playing task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and collected a typing conversation dataset named AntiScam. We collected 220 human-human dialogs. The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable. We recruited two expert annotators who have linguistic training to annotate 3,044 sentences in 100 dialogs, achieving a 0.874 averaged weighted kappa value.\n\nThe PersuasionForGood dataset BIBREF1 was collected from typing conversations on Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Two workers were randomly paired, one was assigned the role of persuader, the other was persuadee. The goal of the persuader was to persuade the persuadee to donate a portion of task earning to a specific charity. The dataset consists of 1,017 dialogs, where 300 dialogs are annotated with dialog acts. The average conversation length is 10.43, the vocabulary size is 8,141. Since the original PersuasionForGood dataset is annotated with dialog acts, we select the on-task dialog acts as on-task intents shown in Table TABREF2, and categorize the other dialog acts into our pre-defined off-task intents.\n\nThe TransferTransfo framework was proposed to build open domain dialog systems. BIBREF0 wolf2019transfertransfo fine-tuned the generative pre-training model (GPT) BIBREF32 with the PERSONA-CHAT dataset BIBREF33 in a multi-task fashion, where the language model objective is combined with a next-utterance classification task. The language model's objective is to maximize the following likelihood for a given sequence of tokens, $X = \\lbrace x_1,\\dots ,x_n\\rbrace $:\n\nThe authors also trained a classifier to distinguish the correct next-utterance appended to the input human utterances from a set of randomly selected utterance distractors. In addition, they introduced dialog state embeddings to indicate speaker role in the model. The model significantly outperformed previous baselines over both automatic evaluations and human evaluations in social conversations. Since the TransferTransfo framework performs well in open domain, we adapt it for non-collaborative settings.", "We suspect the underlying reason is that there are more possible responses with the same intent in PersuasionForGood than in AntiScam. This also suggests that we should adjust the model structure according to the nature of the dataset.\n\nWe propose a general dialog system pipeline to build non-collaborative dialog systems, including a hierarchical annotation scheme and an end-to-end neural response generation model called MISSA. With the hierarchical annotation scheme, we can distinguish on-task and off-task intents. MISSA takes both on and off-task intents as supervision in its training and thus can deal with diverse user utterances in non-collaborative settings. Moreover, to validate MISSA's performance, we create a non-collaborate dialog dataset that focuses on deterring phone scammers. MISSA outperforms all baseline methods in terms of fluency, coherency, and user engagement on both the newly proposed anti-scam task and an existing persuasion task. However, MISSA still produces responses that are not consistent with their distant conversation history as GPT can only track a limited history span. In future work, we plan to address this issue by developing methods that can effectively track longer dialog context.\n\nThis work was supported by DARPA ASED Program HR001117S0050.

We give both workers specific personal data. Instructions are shown in Table TABREF24. The \u201cattacker\u201d additionally receives training on how to elicit information from people. Workers cannot see their partners' instructions.\n\nThere are two tasks for the users: firstly, users are required to chat with their partners and determine if they are attackers or not, reporting their decisions at the end of the task. If users think their partners are attackers, they are instructed to prolong the conversation and elicit information from their partners."]}

Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\n\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance. We then report the average value of those scores over turns as the final extended response-intent prediction result.\n\nAutomatic metrics only validate the system\u2019s performance on a single dimension at a time. The ultimate holistic evaluation should be conducted by having the trained system interact with human users. Therefore we also conduct human evaluations for the dialog system built on AntiScam. We test our models and baselines with 15 college-student volunteers. Each of them is asked to pretend to be an attacker and interact with all the models for at least three times to avoid randomness. We in total collect 225 number of dialogs. Each time, volunteers are required to use similar sentences and strategies to interact with all five models and score each model based on the metrics listed below at the end of the current round. Each model receives a total of 45 human ratings, and the average score is reported as the final human-evaluation score. In total, we design five different metrics to assess the models' conversational ability whilst interacting with humans. The results are shown in Table TABREF19.\n\nFluency Fluency is used to explore different models' language generation quality.", "Compared with these works, MISSA is end-to-end trainable and thus easier to train and update.\n\nTo decouple syntactic and semantic information in utterances and provide detailed supervision, we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.\n\nIn the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).\n\nFor specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.", "Therefore, we need to design a system that handles both on-task and off-task information appropriately and in a way that leads back to the system's goal.\n\nTo tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as \u201copen question\" are general to all tasks.\n\nPrevious studies use template-based methods to maintain sentence coherence. However, rigid templates lead to limited diversity, causing the user losing engagement. On the other hand, language generation models can generate diverse responses but are bad at being coherent. We propose Multiple Intents and Semantic Slots Annotation Neural Network (MISSA) to combine the advantages of both template and generation models and takes advantage from the hierarchical annotation at the same time. MISSA follows the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0 with three modifications: (i) We first concurrently predict user's, system's intents and semantic slots; (ii) We then perform conditional generation to improve generated response's coherence. Specifically, we generate responses conditioned on the above intermediate representation (intents and slots); (iii) Finally, we generate multiple responses with the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5 and then apply a response filter, which contains a set of pre-defined constraints to select coherent responses.

As non-collaborative tasks are still relatively new to the study of dialog systems, there are insufficiently many meaningful datasets for evaluation and we hope this provides a valuable example.", "BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.\n\nTraditional task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF12 are usually composed of multiple independent modules, for example, natural language understanding, dialog state tracking BIBREF13, BIBREF14, dialog policy manager BIBREF15, and natural language generation BIBREF16. Conversational intent is adopted to capture the meaning of task content in these dialog systems BIBREF2, BIBREF17. In comparison to this work, we use a hierarchical intent scheme that includes off-task and on-task intents to capture utterance meaning. We also train the model in a multi-task fashion to predict decoupled intents and semantic slots. The major defect of a separately trained pipeline is the laborious dialog state design and annotation. In order to mitigate this problem, recent work has explored replacing independent modules with end-to-end neural networks BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Our model also follows this end-to-end fashion.\n\nOver the last few years, we have witnessed a huge growth in non-task-oriented dialog systems BIBREF21, BIBREF22. Social chatbots such as Gunrock BIBREF23 were able to maintain a conversation for around ten minutes in an open domain. Recent improvements build on top of the transformer and pre-trained language models BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, obtained state-of-the-art results on the Persona-Chat dataset BIBREF0. Pre-trained language models are proposed to build task-oriented dialog systems to drive the progress on leveraging large amounts of available unannotated data. BIBREF27. Similarly, our approach is also built on top of the TransferTransfo framework BIBREF0.

Compared with MISSA-sel, MISSA achieves better performance on all the metrics. For example, the engagement score for MISSA is 3.69 while MISSA-sel only has 2.87.

We count the average type of information (name, address and phone number) that the system obtained from attackers as the task success score.\n\nTable TABREF19 presents the main experiment results on AntiScam dataset, for both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics. The experiment results on PersuasionForGood are shown in Table TABREF23. We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\n\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents.", "So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\n\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information.

We observe that MISSA outperforms two baseline models (TransferTransfo and hybrid model) on almost all the metrics on both datasets. For further analysis, examples of real dialogs from the human evaluation are presented in Table TABREF21.\n\nCompared to the first TransferTransfo baseline, MISSA outperforms the TransferTransfo baseline on the on-task contents. From Table TABREF19, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with TransferTransfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations.\n\nCompared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table TABREF21, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not. We suspect it is because the hybrid model does not have the built-in semantic slot predictor.", "$\\lambda _{LM}$, $\\lambda _{I_h}$, $\\lambda _{S_h}$, $\\lambda _{I_s}$, $\\lambda _{S_s}$, and $\\lambda _{nup}$ are the hyper-parameters that control the relative importance of every loss.\n\nMISSA can generate multiple sentences in a single system turn. Therefore, we perform system generation conditioned on predicted system intents. More specifically, during the training phase, in addition to inserting a special $<$sep$>$ token at the end of each sentence, we also insert the intent of the system response as special tokens at the head of each sentence in the system response. For example, in Figure FIGREF6, we insert a $<$pos_ans$>$ token at the head of $S_t^1$, which is the system response in green. We then use a cross entropy loss function to calculate the loss between the predicted token and the ground truth intent token. During the testing phase, the model first generates a special intent token, then after being conditioned on this intent token, the model keeps generating a sentence until it generates a $<$sep$>$ token. After that, the model continues to generate another intent token and another sentence until it generates an $<$eos$>$ token.\n\nSince we only perform conditional generation, a type of soft constraint on the predicted intent of system response, the system can still generate samples that violate simple conversation regulations, such as eliciting information that has already been provided. These corner cases may lead to fatal results in high-risk tasks, for example, health care and education. To improve the robustness of MISSA and improve its ability to generalize to more tasks, we add a response filtering module after the generation. With the nucleus sampling strategy BIBREF5, MISSA is able to generate multiple diverse candidate responses with different intents and semantic slots. We then adopt a task-specific response filtering policy to choose the best candidate response as the final output. In our anti-scam scenario, we set up a few simple rules to filter out some unreasonable candidates, for instance, eliciting the repeated information. The filtering module is easily adaptable to different domains or specific requirements, which makes our dialog system more controllable.\n\nWe evaluate MISSA on two non-collaborative task datasets.", "The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset. Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\n\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents. Specifically, we estimate the transition probability $p(I_i|I_j)$ by counting the frequency of all the bi-gram human-intent and system-intent pairs in the training data. During the test stage, if the predicted intent matches the ground truth, we set the score as 1, otherwise we set the score as $p(I_{predict}|I_i)$ where $I_i$ is the intent of the input human utterance. We then report the average value of those scores over turns as the final extended response-intent prediction result.\n\nAutomatic metrics only validate the system\u2019s performance on a single dimension at a time. The ultimate holistic evaluation should be conducted by having the trained system interact with human users. Therefore we also conduct human evaluations for the dialog system built on AntiScam. We test our models and baselines with 15 college-student volunteers. Each of them is asked to pretend to be an attacker and interact with all the models for at least three times to avoid randomness. We in total collect 225 number of dialogs. Each time, volunteers are required to use similar sentences and strategies to interact with all five models and score each model based on the metrics listed below at the end of the current round. Each model receives a total of 45 human ratings, and the average score is reported as the final human-evaluation score. In total, we design five different metrics to assess the models' conversational ability whilst interacting with humans. The results are shown in Table TABREF19.\n\nFluency Fluency is used to explore different models' language generation quality.", "We follow the original TransferTransfo design BIBREF0 and train with undelexicalized data.\n\nHybrid Following BIBREF4 yu2017learning, we also build a hybrid dialog system by combining vanilla TransferTransfo and MISSA. Specifically, we first determine if the human utterances are on-task or off-task with human intent classifier. If the classifier decides that the utterance is on-task, we choose the response from MISSA; otherwise, we choose the response from vanilla TransferTransfo baseline.\n\nIn addition, we perform ablation studies on MISSA to show the effects of different components.\n\nMISSA-sel denotes MISSA without response filtering.\n\nMISSA-con denotes MISSA leaving out the intent token at the start of the response generation.\n\nPerplexity Since the canonical measure of a good language model is perplexity, which indicates the error rate of the expected word. We choose perplexity to evaluate the model performance.\n\nResponse-Intent Prediction (RIP) $\\&$ Response-Slot Prediction (RSP) Different from open-domain dialog systems, we care about the intents of the system response in non-collaborative tasks as we hope to know if the system response satisfies user intents. For example, in the anti-scam task, if the attacker elicits information from the system, we need to know if the system refuses or agrees to provide the information. Therefore we care about intent prediction for the generated system response. Since our baselines are more suited for social chat as they cannot produce system intents, we use the system intent and slot classifiers trained in our model to predict their responses' intents and slots. The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset. Then we compare the predicted values with human-annotated ground truth in the dataset to compute the response-intent prediction (RIP) and response-slot prediction (RSP).\n\nExtended Response-Intent Prediction (ERIP) $\\&$ Extended Response-Slot Prediction (ERSP) With Response-Intent Prediction, we verify the predicted intents to evaluate the coherence of the dialog. However, the real mapping between human-intent and system-intent is much more complicated as there might be multiple acceptable system-intents for the same human-intent. Therefore, we also design a metric to evaluate if the predicted system-intent is in the set of acceptable intents."]}
